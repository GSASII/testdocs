This is based on the example shown at
https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/gh_workflow/ 

Some math here:
```{math}
   g = \left( \begin{matrix}
   a^2 & a b\cos\gamma & a c\cos\beta \\
   a b\cos\gamma & b^2 & b c \cos\alpha \\
   a c\cos\beta &  b c \cos\alpha & c^2
   \end{matrix}\right)
```

More math, but embedded
{math}`d^* = \sqrt {A_0 h^2 + A_1 k^2 + A_2 l^2 + A_3 hk + A_4 hl + A_5 kl}`
in a line of text.
